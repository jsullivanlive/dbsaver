  - get proactive notifications if someone else changed a lot of records in your org
  - get notified of new users 
  - see if any code was deployed or tests stop working
  - get notified about common problems in your org that should be fixed
- marketing software for building sites and lead forms from within salesforce so you don't have to buy wordpress
- backup tool so you can own your data backups
- AI powered admin assistant which learns from all admin changes in all orgs and recommends fields, reports, and workflows to create
- machine learning wizard to feed data into common regression algos
- faster salesforce mobile app
- more open/transparent salesforce appexchange 
- open source esignature + payment page hosted on force.com sites so you can just install and get going selling stuff instead of having to buy docusign, integrate, then figure out the payment stuff, etc.  
- markov chains to predict the next thing that is likely to happen to a record when you're viewing it
